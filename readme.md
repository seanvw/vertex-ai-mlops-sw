# This version

This code and documentation was taken from StatMike's repository under the terms of the Apache License and makes some simple code changes to have the tutorial workflow operate within my own GCP environment. Also some other minor changes e.g. to view some structures for my understanding. You should refer to the authoratative version from StatMike. His tutorials are excellent and highly recommended.
